Running Servers:
=================

If you want to run dedicated servers you can use the dedicated server scripts:

Uebergame-dedicated.sh for running a Linux dedicated server.
Uebergame-dedicated.bat for running a Windows dedicated server.

You may want to adjust the scripts for your needs, but basically what they do
is running the game as a dedicated server with the needed parameters and provide
a restart loop, since in the past the dedicated servers used to get lost from
the server list after a while or they crashed, so you can put a time where they
automatically restart in case you want to run them long time and not care about them.
