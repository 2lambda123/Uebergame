This is a dedicated server framework from Max Gaming Technologies, LLC

I planned to integrate this system, since it will allow you to set up multiple dedicated servers 
with different config files and map rotations from one instance.

This is currently not integrated, so I have no idea if and how good it works and if it needs to be adapted to cover Uebergame features.
In case anyone ever reads this and wants to help integrate it, you can try it, also read the README.txt in this folder for further instructions.
